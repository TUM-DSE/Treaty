# Treaty

Treaty is a secure distributed KV store with distributed Txs. 

We build on TEEs, i.e., Intel SGX, to provide trust and security for transactions in a distributed settings of TEEs.
You can find more details in our [DSN'22 paper](https://dse.in.tum.de/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Treaty_PDFExpress.pdf).

## Notes
We used a internal development version of SCONE and Speicher to implement Treaty. 
We have not tested it with the publicly available version.
